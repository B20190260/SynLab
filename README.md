1D synchrosqueezed wave packet transforms (SSWPT):    Analyzing instantaneous properties (instantaneous frequencies, phases and amplitudes) of non-linear oscillatory signals in a superposition. 2D synchrosqueezed curvelet transform (SSCT):     Anlayzing local properties of non-linear oscillatory textures in a superposition. Applications:    Geophysics:  seismic wave field separation and ground-roll removal.    Materials science:  atomic crystal image analysis, grain boundary and local defects identification, elastic deformation estimation.    Art:  Canvas painting analysis for art forensics.
